Better Approach: Time Com­plex­ity — O(n).

Find the range = y-x;
Do the lin­ear scan of array.
Check if ele­ment falls within the range of x and y, (arrA[i]>=x && arrA[i]<=y)
If Yes then cal­cu­late z = arrA[i]-x;
Make the arrA[z] ele­ment as negative.
Once the lin­ear scan is done, just check all the ele­ments in arrA[] from 0 to range are neg­a­tive, if yes them array con­tains all the num­bers of the given range, return true, else false.
